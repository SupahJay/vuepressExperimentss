## what I was doing before:

I was testing how create methods/functions and other vue things on Vuepress  
Observing how it reacts...  
--->test-js.vue

**so far:**

You cant use console.log on an event in a tag, (pehaps because you should mount the function where browser-js would run?)

**Goal:**

Create global methods on vuepress.

**why:**

So I can filter the nav to only show pages with the atribute {nav:true}. (in vue i can filter in loops with a method)
  
  
**Latter**
try to filter with an inline function...?
